        Cynergy aims to develop a healthy coding culture at RUAS. To achieve this, we plan to bring about an environment 
        where students compete with their peers to earn the title of being the best, using competitive programming as the platfrom. 
        Skills that are forged in this atmosphere are valuable and essential for a programmer.

        Competing with others is not the only way to become a programmer. Problem solving skills and the ability to work in teams is vital as 
        well. Realizing this, we aim to be a platform where students can get involved in social coding session, where they can contribute or 
        group together to start a project. We also encourage students to participate in hackathons and competitions, furthering their 
        experience.
